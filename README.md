## Quick Start

Decentralized AI Nexus (DAIN) is a groundbreaking platform integrating
blockchain and AI to overcome data fragmentation and privacy challenges.
By leveraging federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP),
DAIN enables secure cross-institutional collaboration without exposing raw data.
Its hybrid architecture combines IPFS decentralized storage, a Proof-of-Resource-Allocation (PoRA) consensus,
and encrypted data sandboxes using TEE technology. The ecosystem features a tokenized data marketplace where datasets
are traded as NFTs, while AI models with on-chain "DNA fingerprints" ensure transparent provenance tracking. DAIN's
three-token system ($DAIN, $FUEL, $CREDIT) incentivizes data sharing, computational resource allocation, and model development.
Initial applications focus on healthcare (multi-hospital research with GDPR compliance) and fintech (collaborative fraud detection),
with built-in regulatory tools for automated compliance auditing.

<b>DAIN has only been tested under python3.8 pyhont3.9 at the moment, other versions have not been tested.</b>






## Strategy pool

1. Four-Layer Hybrid Network
- Data Layer: Decentralized storage network based on IPFS, ensuring tamper-proof data traceability.
- Compute Layer: PoRA (Proof of Resource Allocation) consensus algorithm that dynamically allocates GPU/CPU resources for AI tasks.
- Model Layer: Federated learning framework with ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) to validate training integrity without exposing raw data.
- Application Layer: Modular smart contract templates for customized AI services (e.g., prediction markets, automated decision systems).














## TODO

- [x] Launch mainnet with healthcare/fintech pilots, onboard 100+ certified enterprise nodes, and release SDK for federated learning integration.
- [x] Achieve cross-chain interoperability, deploy quantum-resistant modules, and establish regulatory sandboxes in 5+ jurisdictions.
- [ ] Transition to full DAO governance, develop AGI safety protocols, and become foundational infrastructure for Web3 AI economy.
-







## Warning

DAIN is an experimental platform combining emerging technologies. Users must understand:
- Technical Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities or AI model biases may exist despite audits.
- Regulatory Uncertainty: Compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal advisors before enterprise use.
Always verify data/model sources and conduct independent assessments. This notice does not constitute professional advice.
